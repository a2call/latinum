Latinum is a framework for resource and currency calculations.

Basic Usage
-----------

Latinum has several core concepts:

- A `Resource` represents an immutable value with a specific face name (e.g. `'USD'`).
- A `Resource` can only be combined with resources with the same face name.
- A `Bank` is responsible for managing currencies and formatting options.
- A `Bank` can exchange currencies explicitly with a given set of exchange rates.
- A `Collection` is responsible for adding currencies together and is completely deterministic.

### Resources and Collections ###

To create a new resource, use a string for accuracy:

	> ten = Latinum::Resource.new("10.00", "NZD")
	=> 10.0 NZD
	> ten.amount == "10.00".to_d
	=> true

You can add resources of different values but with the same name:

	> ten + ten
	=> 20.0 NZD

But, you can't add resources of different names together:

	> twenty = Latinum::Resource.new("20.00", "AUD")
	=> 20.0 AUD
	> ten + twenty
	ArgumentError: Cannot operate on different currencies!

To add multiple currencies together, use a collection:

	> currencies = Set.new
	> collection = Latinum::Collection.new(currencies)
	> collection << [ten, twenty]
	> currencies.collect {|currency| collection[currency]}
	=> [10.0 NZD, 20.0 AUD]

### Banks and Exchange Rates ###

The bank is responsible for formatting and exchange rates:

	require 'latinum/bank'
	require 'latinum/currencies/global'
	
	> bank = Latinum::Bank.new(Latinum::Currencies::Global)
	> bank << Latinum::ExchangeRate.new("NZD", "AUD", "0.5")
	
	> nzd = Latinum::Resource.new("10", "NZD")
	=> 10.0 NZD
	> aud = bank.exchange nzd, "AUD"
	=> 5.0 AUD

Formatting an amount is typically required for presentation to the end user:

	> bank.format(nzd)
	=> "$10.00 NZD"
	
	> bank.format(aud, :format => :compact)
	=> "$5.00"

The bank can also be used to parse currency, which will depend on the priority of currencies if a symbol that matches multiple currencies is supplied:

	> bank.parse("$5")
	=> 5.0 USD
	
	> bank.parse("€5")
	=> 5.0 EUR

Currency codes take priority over symbols if specified:

	> bank.parse("€5 NZD")
	=> 5.0 NZD
